# GameMaker-Physics-System-Demo
 A simple example project demonstrating GameMaker's in-built physics system

 You need to make sure any object you want to apply physics to has the "uses physics" box ticked.
 If you want to have an object with collisions, but does not fall due to gravity, you neeed to change its density to zero in the physics menu (in this case oWall uses this).
 
 Ignore the FPS counter, that was just for extreme testing - It should stay at 60 for the whole duration the game is running

 Might add other shapes/sizes soon
